# My Personal Project (Movie Collection App)

## Application Mechanism

By using the Movie Collection application, users can create a **list of movie** into the app. The **movie** itself contains some relevant information such as:
- title
- director
- genre 
- duration 
for the movie. Then, users can enter the information and their personal rating for the **movie**.

## Application Usage & Interest

As for the functionality of this application, **cinema enjoyers** can use this app as a collection for the movies that they've already watched. I am inspired to create this project because recently watching movies in cinema has been a part of my interest to spend some time together with my friends.
