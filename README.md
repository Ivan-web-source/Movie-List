# My Personal Project (m-Banking App)

## Application Mechanism

By using the m-Cinema application, users will see a **list of movie** into the app. The **movie** itself contains some relevant information such as:
- genre 
- duration 
- minimum age, and
- available seats 
for the movie. Then, users will be able to choose which **movie** are they watching and enter the amount of seats they are booking.

## Application Usage & Interest

As for the functionality of this application, **cinema owners and enjoyers** can use this app as a tool to aid their booking process. I wanted to create this project because recently watching movies in cinema has been a part of my interest to spend some time together with my friends.
